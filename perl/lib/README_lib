#   Sysnopsis   ./lib is the home for all custom perl modules
#               
#               Main purpose of     ./lib is code reuse, 
#                                   - increased prototyping speed
#                                   - code robustness
#                                   - code documentation
#                                   - clean structure of code base
#                                   - reduction in code size
#               Purpose             A module should be limited in Scope, 
#                                   - general in nature, not application specific
#                                   - easy to comprehend and human understandable
